# project3-roombooking

RoomBooking RoomBooking is a CLI application that allows users to manage room bookings for a hotel or similar establishment. The project utilizes Python and click for creating, modifying, and querying bookings.

SQLAlchemy: Used for object-relational mapping (ORM) to interact with the database. Click: Provides a framework for building command-line interfaces. Alembic: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. Database Schema The project uses SQLAlchemy ORM to define and manage the database schema. The schema includes three main tables:

Rooms: Represents the available rooms in the establishment. Contains information such as room number, type, capacity, and price. Customers: Stores customer details, including name, phone number, and email. Bookings: Tracks the bookings made by customers, including check-in and check-out dates. The database schema design is implemented in the models.py file, which contains the SQLAlchemy model definitions for each table.

Usage The RoomBooking CLI application offers the following functionality:

Creating new bookings: Users can create bookings by specifying the room, customer, and check-in/check-out dates. Managing bookings: Users can modify and cancel existing bookings. Checking room availability: Users can check if a room is available for a specific date range. Retrieving booking details: Users can view information about their bookings, including current, past, and upcoming bookings. The CLI follows best practices and provides detailed prompts and messages throughout the execution. It also incorporates validation for user input to ensure data integrity.

DSA Execution The RoomBooking project incorporates the use of lists, tuples, and dictionaries within the CLI application. Additionally, it utilizes one or more algorithms from the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) module in appropriate contexts. These elements enhance the functionality and efficiency of the application.

CLI Best Practices The CLI application separates scripted elements from object-oriented code, adhering to best practices. It validates user input to prevent errors and provides detailed prompts and messages to guide users through the booking process. The project also leverages external libraries to minimize project-specific code, promoting maintainability and reusability.
